# Product Strategy


Problem:
Doordash is looking to automate food delivery using self-driving robots for trips that are less than 2 miles in order to reduce its operating costs and provide more reliable delivery times. The long term goal is that these delivery robots will navigate sidewalks fully autonomously. But initially, there may be times when manual intervention will be required.
Task was to build a tool for the operations team-- to view the status of deliveries and remotely take control of robots that need intervention.

Developed and delivered a market-based, insight driven pitch for new product that was targeted to executive stakeholders
